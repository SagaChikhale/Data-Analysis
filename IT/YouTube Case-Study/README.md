## 3. Understanding Viewer Reactions for each video (sentiment counts)

The goal is to understand the distribution of sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) across various YouTube videos.

**Findings:**

The analysis revealed the following sentiment distribution for the YouTube videos:

| Video ID | nan | Negative | Neutral | Positive | Total Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| JinobXWPk | 47 | 1 | 51 | 1 | 100 |
| -1fzGnFwz9M | 68 | 0 | 30 | 2 | 100 |
| -3AGlBYyLjo | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 4 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| zqE-ultsWt0 | 305 | 2 | 183 | 10 | 500 |
| zrOHeEA14kQ | 257 | 0 | 240 | 0 | 497 |
| zuKX0fPlo2Q | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| zuUQDdWNAPc | 95 | 0 | 101 | 4 | 200 |
| zyPIdeF4NFI | 246 | 0 | 132 | 22 | 400 |

**Explanation of nan Values:**

The "nan" values in the dataset indicate that the corresponding comment could not be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. This might be due to various reasons, such as:

* Ambiguous Content: The comment might contain mixed or unclear sentiments.
* Lack of Sentiment Words: The comment might not contain enough words or phrases that can be associated with positive or negative emotions.
* Different Language: The comments could be in different languages.

It's important to note that "nan" values are not null values. They represent a specific category in this analysis, indicating that the sentiment could not be determined.

## 4. Analyzing Comment Length and Sentiment

The goal is to determine if there is a correlation between the length of a comment and its sentiment.

**Findings:**

The analysis revealed a weak negative correlation between comment length and sentiment. This indicates that longer comments are slightly more likely to be negative than shorter comments. However, the correlation coefficient of -0.008709 suggests that the relationship is weak and not statistically significant.

This indicates that comments with slightly negative sentiments tend to receive slightly more likes than those with positive or neutral sentiments. However, the correlation coefficient of -0.0007664447517908679 suggests that the relationship is extremely weak and not statistically significant.

**Most Common Words:**

The most common word in YouTube video titles is the hyphen (-). This suggests that hyphens are often used to separate words or create compound terms in video titles.

                                                  Most Common Words in Video Titles

![title common words](https://github.com/SagaChikhale/Data-Analysis/blob/master/IT/YouTube%20Case-Study/images/title%20word%20analysis%20with%20puctuation.jpg)

When the punctuations are removed, the word "de" becomes the most common word. This could imply a few things:

* **Language Preference:** The dataset might contain a significant number of videos in languages where "de" is a common word or prefix (e.g., Spanish, Dutch, German).
* **Topic Trends:** The word "de" might be frequently used in specific topics or niches that are popular on YouTube.
* **Title Formatting:** "De" could be used as part of a specific naming convention or style often employed in YouTube video titles.

                                                  Most Common Words in Video Titles without Punctuations
